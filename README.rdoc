= DESCRIPTION:

there is a default listener : /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/network/admin

= REQUIREMENTS:


= ATTRIBUTES: 

= USAGE:

= TODO:
--set iptables port access rather than allowing all connections
--manage the entire listener and tnsnames, and use the ip of the machine instead of "localhost", otherwise remote access doesn't seem to work.
-- "No such file or directory - lsnrctl start" because environment variables aren't getting set correctly. we also need to run this as the oracle user. http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17781_01/install.112/e18802/toc.htm#autoId17
-- "sqlplus: command not found" because environment variables aren't getting set correctly. see above

-- better chaining and notifications within the provisioning. we should be able to run vagrant provision as many times as we want and be fresh.
